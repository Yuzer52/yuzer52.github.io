        <h2>How the rules work?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Players:</strong> 2â€“4 players can play Ludo. Each player chooses a color (green, yellow, red, or blue) and places four pieces of that color in the corresponding starting circle.</li>
            <li><strong>Starting position:</strong> Pieces start their circuit one square in from the end of their arm and next to their prison.</li>
            <li><strong>Taking turns:</strong> The player with the highest roll of the die goes first, and then play continues clockwise. On each turn, a player rolls two dice and can move two pieces.</li>
            <li><strong>Moving pieces:</strong> To move a piece out of prison, a player must roll a 6. A player can also draw a piece from home if they roll a 1 or the sum of the dice is 1. If a player rolls a double, they can move two pieces in the same turn.</li>
            <li><strong>Capturing pieces:</strong> If a piece lands on a piece of a different color, the other piece is sent back to its prison.</li>
            <li><strong>Blockades:</strong> When two pieces of the same color are on the same square, it's called a blockade.</li>
            <li><strong>Winning:</strong> The first player to move all four of their pieces clockwise around the board, up the home column, and into the home triangle wins. The remaining players continue playing to determine the runners-up.</li>
        </ul>
